#Welcome!

This is the first section (core python) from the Practical Python module for CodeInstitute.

It demonstrates a few (very) basic functions in Python:

- Printing a message
- Defining and printing a list
- Importing a module by installing it with pip install [modulename] and then importing it in a .py file
- Building a requirements.txt file with pip freeze > requirements.txt
